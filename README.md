# Python Data Cleaning Automation

## 🎯 The Problem
Small businesses often struggle with "dirty data"—messy spreadsheets with duplicate entries, inconsistent formatting, and missing values that make reporting impossible.

## ✅ The Solution
This Python script uses the **Pandas** library to automatically:
- Remove duplicate rows based on unique identifiers (Email).
- Standardize text casing for Names and Emails.
- Clean currency symbols and convert columns to numerical types.
- Handle missing values to ensure data integrity.

## 📈 Results
- **Processing Time:** Reduced from hours of manual work to seconds.
- **Accuracy:** 100% consistency in data formatting.
